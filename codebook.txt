CODEBOOK

Generally speaking, variable names from the original data set are unchanged. 

For combinedMeanStd data frame:
COLUMN 1: "type"
        Indicates whether the data is from the 'test' or 'train' dataset.
COLUMN 2: "Subject" 
        Indicates the subject performing the activity.
COLUMN 3: "aID"
        Descriptive value indicating the activity being performed.
COLUMNS 4 to 82: 
        Correspond to variables found in found in the file 'features_info.txt' included with the original data set.

For ActSubMeans data frame:
The descriptions of the headings for columns 2:562 can be found in the file 'features_info.txt' included with the original data set.

The exceptions in the output 'ActSubMeans' data frame and corresponding 'Activity and Subject Means.txt' are as follows:
COLUMN 1: "aID (descriptive) or Subject (numeric)"
        This column contains descriptive names for the 6 specific activities perfomed and numeric values indicating the subject performing activities.
COLUMNS 563 to 1714:
        These 1152 columns are the inclusion of the 'Inertial Signals' data.
        There are 128 columns, representing 128 measurements, per set of data spanning 9 sets (9*128=1152).
        The following is the order the sets of 128 are included in, from left to right:
        1] BAx1:BAx128 are the Body Acceleration x-axis values
        2] BAy1:BAy128 are the Body Acceleration y-axis values
        3] BAz1:BAz128 are the Body Acceleration z-axis values
        4] BGx1:BGx128 are the Body Gyro x-axis values
        5] BGy1:BGy128 are the Body Gyro y-axis values
        6] BGz1:BGz128 are the Body Gyro z-axis values
        7] TAx1:TAx128 are the Total Acceleration x-axis values
        8] TAy1:TAy128 are the Total Acceleration y-axis values
        9] TAz1:TAz128 are the Total Acceleration z-axis values
